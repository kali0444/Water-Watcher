*** WATER WATCHER (aka Water Pump Controller) ***

Hello all genius minds.
This is my first design as a Beginner PCB Designer,

- Working- Whenever needed, i manually switch ON the wall socket switch to run motor and motor will automatically stop and indicator led starts blinking and buzzer making sound to alert me when the water tank is full, then i will manually switch OFF the wall socket switch.

- I have used NE556 Timer IC to build it.
- I have used connector -J1 for my system powering (~5VDC), 
			-J2 (2 pins will be at the top portion inside the tank and get short when water reaches the maximum 				height),
			-J3 (a switch)for bypass my system in case of issue, 
			-J4 for controlling my 1HP water pump (Live wire).



- I appreciate if you guide me to make it better and efficient.
